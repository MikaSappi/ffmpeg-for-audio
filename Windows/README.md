# Original repository: [BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds)

This is a modified version to output FFmpeg in a specific format.

Contents in the `Windows` directory are licensed per the [original license](Windows/LICENSE.md).

Please note that `scripts.d` doesn't contain all of the files it normally would. Disabled components are in `scripts.d.disabled`. Please also note that `50-fdk-aac.sh` contains optional flags that may or may not work for you.

## Package List

For a list of included dependencies check the scripts.d directory.
Every file corresponds to its respective package.

## How to make a build

### Prerequisites

* bash
* docker

### Build Image

* `./makeimage.sh target variant [addin [addin] [addin] ...]`

### Build FFmpeg

* `./build.sh target variant [addin [addin] [addin] ...]`

On success, the resulting zip file will be in the `artifacts` subdir.

### Targets, Variants and Addins

Available targets:
* `win64` (x86_64 Windows)
* `win32` (x86 Windows)
* `linux64` (x86_64 Linux, glibc>=2.28, linux>=4.18)
* `linuxarm64` (arm64 (aarch64) Linux, glibc>=2.28, linux>=4.18)

The linuxarm64 target will not build some dependencies due to lack of arm64 (aarch64) architecture support or cross-compiling restrictions.

* `davs2` and `xavs2`: aarch64 support is broken.
* `libmfx` and `libva`: Library for Intel QSV, so there is no aarch64 support.

Available variants:
* `gpl` Includes all dependencies, even those that require full GPL instead of just LGPL.
* `lgpl` Lacking libraries that are GPL-only. Most prominently libx264 and libx265.
* `nonfree` Includes fdk-aac in addition to all the dependencies of the gpl variant.
* `gpl-shared` Same as gpl, but comes with the libav* family of shared libs instead of pure static executables.
* `lgpl-shared` Same again, but with the lgpl set of dependencies.
* `nonfree-shared` Same again, but with the nonfree set of dependencies.

All of those can be optionally combined with any combination of addins:
* `4.4`/`5.0`/`5.1`/`6.0`/`6.1`/`7.0`/`7.1` to build from the respective release branch instead of master.
* `debug` to not strip debug symbols from the binaries. This increases the output size by about 250MB.
* `lto` build all dependencies and ffmpeg with -flto=auto (HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL, broken for Windows, sometimes works for Linux)
